/*
A Cab booking company has a dataset of its trip ratings, each row represents a single trip of a driver. 
A trip has a positive rating if it was rated 4 or above, 
a streak of positive ratings is when a driver has a rating of 4 and above in consecutive trips. 
example: If there are 3 consecutive trips with a rating of 4 or above then the streak is 2.
Find out the maximum streak that a driver has had and sort the output in descending order 
of their maximum streak and then by descending order of driver_id.
Note: only users who have at least 1 streak should be included in the output.
